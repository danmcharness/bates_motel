        will call getRestaurants() when within a certain distance of the bottom, until reaching the end of the list.
        by default, if the component is within 1% of the view area, then it will call the declared method.
        Since initially the view wonâ€™t have any restaurants, it will show a loading indicator and make a call to the
        getRestaurants() method to load the initial set.

        Due to a quirky behavior of the infinite scroll, it can actually call the method twice on load.
        To fix this, we disable the infinite scroll from loading initially setting the immediate-check attribute to
        false, and we will have the controller load the data.

        The infinite scroll component will continue to request data as long as it returns and anytime it becomes visible.
        However, when there are no more items to load we want to stop the component from loading anymore.
        The ngIf statement is how we will disable infinite scroll when we reach the end of our available data from the
        service. We will handle the logic in this controller, but the API is returning a value which indicates how many
        pages of data are available so we can check that against how many have already loaded.
