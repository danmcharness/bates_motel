Note about file organization
----------------------------
Other than the top level application files (index.html & app.js) all application files are organized by views
(./www/views/), so that all related parts are kept together. For example see: ./www/views/reservation


The top-level source files are:
  ./www/index.html
  ./www/js/app.js

The top-level view (template):
  ./www/views/home/home.html
