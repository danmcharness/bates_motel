1. Build application
--------------------

> ionic build android

First time building will involve a whole lot of downloads involving gradle requirements after which a whole lot more
output will display as the build occurs ultimately resulting in the output:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Built the following apk(s):
        /home/puddle/work-spaces/ws-ionic/ionic-in-action/bates_motel/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk


If the android target is outdated you may get the following typical output:

    [Error: Please install Android target: "android-22".

    Hint: Open the SDK manager by running: /home/puddle/android-sdk-linux/tools/android
    You will require:
    1. "SDK Platform" for android-22
    2. "Android SDK Platform-tools (latest)
    3. "Android SDK Build-tools" (latest)]
    ERROR building one of the platforms: Error: /home/puddle/work-spaces/ws-ionic/ionic-in-action/bates_motel/platforms/android/cordova/build: Command failed with exit code 2
    You may not have the required environment or OS to build this project
    Error: /home/puddle/work-spaces/ws-ionic/ionic-in-action/bates_motel/platforms/android/cordova/build: Command failed with exit code 2
        at ChildProcess.whenDone (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/cordova/node_modules/cordova-lib/src/cordova/superspawn.js:131:23)
        at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:110:17)
        at maybeClose (child_process.js:1015:16)
        at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:1087:5)

Simply follow the helpful suggestions and subsequent builds will proceed nicely.


2. Deploy application
---------------------

First time deployment of app:

    adb -d install -d ./platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk

        -d         - directs command to the only connected USB device
        install -d - allow version code downgrade

Subsequent deployments of app:

    adb -d install -rd ./platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk

        install -r - replace existing application
